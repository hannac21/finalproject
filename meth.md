#### Compiling the Data

Compiling the data for this project was a very tedious process. For certain sites, data can be somewhat difficult to come by (shocking, I know). Most of my research originated in a handful of books from the Washington and Lee Library, including Monuments of Syria: A Historical Guide, by Ross Burns, and the Historical Dictionary of Syria, by David Commins. From there, I supplemented information for each site from various journals, news articles, and blogs. For many of the sites, I was able to filter through many sources and extract the necessary data from a multitude of sources. However, some proved difficult to come across in both the library and online, so I had to make do with what I had.

Initially, one of my primary issues was determining how much information to include on each site. For some, I could write a few paragraphs on them. For others, I could write entire textbooks. Naturally, some locations would include more information than others, but I aimed to strike a balance between conciseness and effectiveness. In the end, I settled on these primary categories: name, Arabic translation, etymology, religion, earliest date, site, history, significance, and present date. I felt that these categories gave a holistic few of each site without being excessive. All of this data was then compiled onto a master document, and I proceeded to code in the information from this document.

#### Working with Imperfect Data

Obviously, the data is not perfect. I am examining information on sites from the Middle East, some of which are thousands of years old. I did not expect the data to be perfect. As a result of this, many of the dates are approximations, and the timeline may not be entirely accurate. However, I did not feel that the exclusion of specific dates for some of the sites was particularly detrimental, and the use of periods or ranges of years did an adequate job of providing proper historical context for each site. Moreover, some details of certain sites may vary based off of specific religious traditions, and here I attempted to give as holistic a view as possible. Workings with many Western sources, I would not be surprised if the data was slightly skewed towards Christianity.

#### Tools

This project was built using Flâneur, a Jekyll theme which uses the Leaflet mapping library. It was developed by Dawn Childress and Niqui O’Neill. I originally intended to use ArcGIS on a bootstrap site, however I found that ArcGIS did not suit my project particularly well. Moreover, I was not using the extensive mapping features available on that platform. So, I decided to go with this theme, as it provided a very attractive, relatively easy to use map, as well as an article section for all of my sites. I made some adjustments to tailor the framework to my needs and added elements such as the timeline (the framework comes with a timeline tool, however I preferred to build my own.
