With a population of just over 20 million and a land area of only 1.5 times the size of Pennsylvania, Syria may seem like a typical, conflict prone nation in the Middle East. The country has very limited oil wealth, and therefore holds much less of our government's interest. Propelled onto the international scene only a decade ago due to the protests against President Bashar al-Assad and the rising of various terrorist organizations like ISIS, it is still common for people to know the country in name only and not take any interest in it (I did a survey in my high school in 2017: less than 25% of people surveyed could pick out Syria on a map or could name the president). In contrast, almost everyone knew about Iraq and Saddam Hussein 20 years ago.

So, why does Syria matter? Why do people perceive the country as a conflict-ridden, war-torn state that appeared on the map 10 years ago? In reality, Syria was one of the centers of Neolithic culture in 10,000 BC, and was the first place in the world where agriculture and cattle breeding began, making it one of the oldest, if not the oldest, civilization in the world. Syria, at least in part, has been constantly inhabited since then, becoming part of history's most famous empires, like the Babylonian, Egyptian, Assyrian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Umayyad, and Ottoman empires. 

As a result of being a part of these various empires and operating under diverse schools of thought, Syria has come to be home to a large number of significant relgious sites. Even though it is perceived as a typical Muslim country, you can find sites that are extremely significant to Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Greek/Roman relgions, and even religions of ancient antiquity. 

With this project, I mapped out and explained the significance behind some of the most famous relgious sites in Syria, even though there are hundreds of additional locations that I was unable to explore. Even though the nation may be viewed as inconsequential today, I hope to show that it is actually one of the most important areas in history, and still carries significance to thousands, if not millions of people.

Above all, I hope people recgonize that action needs to be taken to protect some of these sites. Some of the sites in this project have already been partially damaged or completely destroyed. They serve as a portal back to the oldest civilizations in history, and if they are not protected, some of their secrets that have not yet been uncovered may be lost forever.
