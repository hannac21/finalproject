Syria has been the subject of many international headlines since the beginning of the Arab Spring in 2011. Despite all of this attention, the world superpowers have all but ruled it insignificant. Very little outside interference has occurred when compared to other Middle-Eastern nations such as Iraq.

Despite the lack of wealth and natural resources that the country has, Syria is home to some of the world's oldest and most influential civilizations. The country has been apart of the world's most famous empires and is home to some of the most famous relgious sites in the world. This project highlights some of these locations and aims to prove that this "insignificant" country actually holds strong relgious significance, and in turn should be important to millions of people around the world.
