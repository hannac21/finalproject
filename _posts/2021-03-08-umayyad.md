**Etymology:** Named after the Umayyad Dynasty

**Religion:** Islam

**Earliest Date:** 715 CE

**Site:** The mosque is a very large rectangular shape. A large courtyard exists in the northern part of the complex, and the courtyard is enclosed. The structure is supported by two sets of columns. There are three domes and three minarets located on the complex. The mosque served as a temple for future mosque construction, as it architectural features inspired mosques across the country and the entirety of the Middle East. 

**History:** The site has been of religious significance since the Iron Age. It was originally a temple dedicated to Hadad-Ramman, the god of thunderstorms and rain. After the Roman conquest of Damascus, the temple was re-dedicated to Jupiter. Towards the end of the 4th century CE, the temple was converted into a Christian basilica dedicated to John the Baptist. According to some, the temple contains the head of John. After the Muslim conquest of Damascus, the Umayyad caliph al-Walid commissioned the construction of the mosque on the site of the basilica dedicated to John the Baptist. Most of the original Christian site was demolished before the construction of the mosque commenced. The project was wildly expensive, and was completed by al-Walid’s successor, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. The mosque, at the time of its completion, was the largest and most impressive mosque in the world, and along with it, the city of Damascus became the capital of the Muslim world. The mosque underwent some minor alterations during Abbasid rule, and the mosque experienced damage to its northern wall during a fire in the 11th century. Restorations commenced shortly after. The mosque changed hands many times throughout history, as different empires conquered and re-conquered the city of Damascus. The mosque underwent major renovations throughout the 20th century. 

**Significance:** This is, potentially, the most famous site in Syria. The mosque holds massive religious significance to both Shia and Sunni Muslims (which is probably the reason that it has gone relatively unharmed during the war). This was the destination of the family of Muhammad after they were made to walk here from Iraq. The head of John the Baptist is believed to be in the Mosque. Moreover, there are shrines commemorating Husayn ibn Ali and Jesus Christ on the compound. This is also the location where Muslims believe that Christ is to return to at the End of Days. In addition to all of this, the mosque is one of the oldest, largest, and most famous in the world, making it one of the most popular pilgrimage sites for Muslims across the world. 

**Present Day:** In 2011, some of the first protests that sparked the beginning of the Syrian Civil War began near the mosque. The mosque has remained relatively undamaged throughout the Civil War.
