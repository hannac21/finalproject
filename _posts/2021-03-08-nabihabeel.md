**Etymology:** According to Jewish, Muslim, and Christian religious texts, Abel was the son of Adam, the first man. He was killed by his brother Cain, the first murder of mankind. The sarcophagus in the mosque is said to hold the remains of Abel. 

**Religion:** Muslim 

**Earliest Date:** 1599

**Site:** A tomb for Abel originally built over the cave that he was said to be murdered in. This tomb is 23-feet long and is covered with a green tapestry inscribed with Quranic verses. 

**Significance:** This is a significant site to Muslims, as the mosque is believed to contain the grave of Abel. This has turned the mosque into a major pilgrimage and ritual site, especially for the Druze. 

**Present Day:** The mosque remains in use.
