**Etymology:** Also known as the Great Synagogue of Aleppo, Joab’s Synagogue, or Al-Bandara Synagogue. It is named after King David’s general, Joab, who was said to have built this when he conquered Aleppo.

**Religion:** Judaism

**Earliest Date:** Legendary founding was by King David’s General, Joab ben Zeruiah, in c.950 BCE. However, it has been a place of worship since the 9th century CE. 

**Site:** The synagogue features several courtyards which were used for worship in warm weather, with the main courtyard featuring a covered pulpit raised 20 stairs above the ground. There are also seven arks across the compound. The western hall is home to three of these arks, all of which were used to hold Torah scrolls. There are another three arks in the southern wall. The seventh and final ark is in the eastern wing, which was used to store the Aleppo Codex. a 10th century manuscript of the Hebrew bible.

**History:** According to legend, the foundation of the synagogue was built by Joab ben Zeruiah when he conquered the city around 950 BCE. However, the oldest surviving manuscript was dated to 834 CE. In the 13th century, after the Mongol conquest of Aleppo, the synagogue was turned into a mosque. It was largely destroyed in the early 15th century and was rebuilt in 1418. It remained as an active place of worship until it was destroyed as a result of violent attacks against local Jews in 1947. It was partially rebuilt in the 1990s but has since stood empty. 

**Significance:** This served as an active place of worship for Syrian Jews until they faced widespread persecution in the 1940s. It was also home to the legendary Aleppo Codex, a 10th century manuscript of the Hebrew bible, for over 500 years. The codex went missing during the attacks on the synagogue in 1947 and portions of it were lost or destroyed. However, part of it resurfaced in the 1950s, and the surviving pieces are on display near the Dead Sea Scrolls in Israel. 

**Present Day:** The synagogue still stands today. It has been empty since the mid 20th century, however, there have been many attempts from international Jewish communities to finance some basic repairs. In 2016, it sustained minor damage as a result of the Civil War.
