**Etymology:** Tablets from Mari record the city’s name as Tadmor in the 18th century BCE, corroborated by Assyrian inscriptions from the 11th century BCE. The name might be connected to the Semitic word for date palm. The Greek name Palmyra, first recorded by Pliny the Elder, likely derives from a Latin or Greek corruption of the name Tadmor.

**Religion:** Ancient Mesopotamian, Greek

**Earliest Date:** c. 2500 BCE

**Site:** A number of notable structures have been unearthed at the site. Some of the public buildings that have been discovered include the original senate building, the Baths of Diocletian, the Tariff Court, and the Palmyra Agora. The Temple of Bel, dated to 32 CE, is a massive structure that includes a Hellenistic Temple, a central shrine, and a large colonnaded portico. The decoration and finish are Hellenistic in nature. Additionally, the site has the Temples of Baalshamin, Nabu, and Baal-Hamon, and is home to the Great Colonnade of Palmyra. 

**History:** Evidence of habitation dates back to the Neolithic period, but the first mention in literary sources in the second millennium BCE. It originated as an Assyrian trade colony and served a stop for many tribes and caravans. The area was conquered and re-conquered many times in the 2nd and 1st millenniums BCE. Around 300 BCE, the city flourished under Seleucid rule. It fell under Roman control in the 1st century BCE and flourished into major economic and trade center in the empire. It continued to prosper under the Romans, and only began to weaken as the Roman empire weakened. It saw a slight resurgence under the Umayyads, but never returned to its pinnacle. The site was built over many times throughout history. 

**Significance:** This site is one of the most famous is Syria. It dates back to the Neolithic Period and is an excellent example of a city that prospered as a city of trade. The city amassed large amounts of wealth from trade and became one of the biggest regional centers in the Middle East. This city was an oasis and served as a midpoint between the Mediterranean and the Fertile Crescent. It contains an excellent architectural record, and has fantastic examples of religious sites dedicated to Ancient Mesopotamian and Roman gods. The site is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

**Present Day:** The site faced widespread destruction from ISIS. The group destroyed a number of the temples and tombs in 2015. However, shortly after this destruction, restoration efforts commenced, and it is believed that a large majority of the damage can be restored.
