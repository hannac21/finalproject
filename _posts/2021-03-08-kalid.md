**Etymology:** The mosque is dedicated to Khalid ibn al-Walid, an Arab military commander who led the Muslim conquest of Syria.

**Religion:** Islam

**Earliest Date:** 13th century

**Site:** The mosque, famous for its nine domes and two minarets, is in traditional Ottoman style. The mausoleum of Khalid ibn al-Walid is located in a corner of the prayer hall. His tomb consists of an ornate dome and heavily decorated interior. 

**History:** The original mosque was reportedly built around Khalid ibn al-Walid’s mausoleum in the 13th century. However, the present-day mosque was completed in the late Turkish period (1908-1913).

**Significance:** The mosque contains the tomb of Khalid ibn al-Walid, an early follower of Muhammad. He was made a commander by Muhammad, and his numerous military campaigns led to the Islamic conquest of Syria. His tomb is now a pilgrimage site. Despite all of this, the mosque achieved notoriety during the Syrian Civil War, as it became an iconic symbol of anti-government forces.

**Present Day:** The mosque served as an arms and ammunition base for rebel forces until it was recaptured by the government in 2013. The mosque was heavily damaged, and the dome of the tomb of Khalid ibn al-Walid was damaged. After significant restoration efforts, the mosque reopened in 2019.
