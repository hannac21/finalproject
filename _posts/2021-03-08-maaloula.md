**Etymology:** It comes from the Aramaic word meaning entrance. 

**Religion:** Christianity: Greek Catholic, Greek Orthodox

**Earliest Date:** Roman Era

**Site:** Located southeast of Damascus, the village sits on a plateau at an elevation of 5,000 feet. Many small houses exist on the slopes up to the city. Two chapels exist above the village, one being Greek Catholic, with the other being Greek Orthodox. Famous churches include the Church of Mar Sarkis (Sr. Sergius), as well as the Convent of Mar Taqla (St. Thecla).

**History:** The village dates back to the Roman Era. The Church of Mar Sarkis was built on the site of a pagan temple and has architectural elements which go back to the Byzantine period. This church is also home to two of the oldest icons in the world. The Convent of Mar Taqla reportedly contains the remains of the Mar Taqla (St. Thecia), who was a pupil of St. Paul. The city has remained widely unchanged, and despite the Arab conquest in the 7th century, maintained Aramaic as its primary language. 

**Significance:** The village is one of three remaining places in the world (all of which are in Syria) where Western Neo-Aramaic is still taught and spoken. With most dialects of Aramaic facing extinction, Maaloula still maintains the language of Christ, making it unlike any other location in the modern world. Also, it serves as a pilgrimage site for the Syrian Christian community. 

**Present Day:** There was a brief conflict between the Syrian Government and rebel forces in 2013 and 2014. It caused some minor damage to the village, and its statue of the Virgin Mary was destroyed. However, in 2015, the village erected a new statue of the Virgin Mary, replacing the figure that had been damaged a year earlier.
