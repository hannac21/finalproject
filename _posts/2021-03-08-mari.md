**Etymology:** The name Mari comes from Mer, a storm deity of Mesopotamia and Syria.

**Religion:** Ancient Mesopotamian

**Earliest Date:** c. 2900 BCE

**Site:** It is located in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border. Excavations have revealed numerous clay tablets, a large palace, and a number of religious temples. The site consists largely of mud-brick remains, and the walls of the palace survive in places to a height of over 15 feet. 

**History:** Mari was originally founded in c. 2900 BCE as a city to act as a hub between the states of the Fertile Crescent and the drier plains of northern Syria. It was built a mile away from the Euphrates, but it was connected to the river via a complex canal system. The city flourished but was often a site of conflict due to its valuable strategic position. Mari was conquered by the Akkadian Empire around 2200 BCE but regained its independence at the end of the millennium. It later came under control of the Babylonian empire and later, the Assyrians. It was conquered once again by Hammurabi and remained under the control of his empire until 1759 BCE, in which it was sacked. The city was no longer a place of significance, and despite signs of limited occupation until the Hellenistic Period, it disappeared from records shortly after that.  

**Significance:** Discovered in 1933, Mari has significantly improved our understanding and knowledge of Syria in the Bronze Age, as well as ancient Mesopotamia. Mari was one of the main royal city-states of its time, and the palace excavated from this site was one of the largest in the Middle East. Over 25,000 tablets that provided important information about the palace and the administration of the kingdom were discovered here. Also, crucial information about 2nd millennium BCE trade networks was also unearthed at Mari. There were also a number of religious buildings discovered which helped provide insight into Ancient-Mesopotamian religions, including the Temple of Dagan, the Temple of Shamash, the Temple of Ninni-Zaza, and the Temple of Ishtar. 

**Present Day:** The site fell under the control of ISIS in 2014. While many of the tablets are preserved in museums around the world, the site was subject to massive destruction and looting, and is now largely destroyed.
