**Etymology:** Also known as the Banu Umayya Mosque of Aleppo

**Religion:** Islam 

**Earliest Date:** 8th century CE and rebuilt from the 11th -14th centuries. 

**Site:** It is located in the al-Jalloum district in the old city of Aleppo. It has many similarities in layout and style to the Great Mosque of Damascus like the spacious courtyard surrounded with porticoes. The mosque is famous for its courtyard floor, which is decorated with black and white stones and geometric patterns. The interior of the mosque contains a shrine to Zechariah, a 15th century minbar, and an elaborate mihrab. 

**History:** The site of the mosque was once an agora of the Hellenistic period. It later was home to the garden for the Cathedral of St. Helena during the Roman rule in Syria. The first version of the mosque was built by the Umayyad caliphs al-Walid and Sulayman ibn al-Malik in order to make their mark in Aleppo. The mosque underwent a significant renovation in the second half of the 11th century, in which a fountain was built in the mosque’s courtyard, as well as a minaret (which was subsequently destroyed in the Syrian Civil War). 

**Significance:** The mosque is said to hold the remains of Zechariah, the father of John the Baptist.

**Present Day:** In 2012 and 2013 during the Syrian Civil War, the mosque was severely damaged to the point that the eleventh century minaret was completely destroyed. There are current attempts to restore the monument. Additionally, the museum attached to the mosque was subject to looting, in which a number of objects, including a box that contained a strand of the Prophet Muhammad’s, were stolen by rebel forces.
