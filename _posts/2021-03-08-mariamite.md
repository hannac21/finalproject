**Religion:** Christianity: Greek Orthodox

**Earliest Date:** Roman Period

**Site:** The church is located near Bab Sharqi on Straight Street (the main Roman road though ancient Damascus where St. Paul reportedly spent a night). The cathedral complex has three sections: the Church of Mary, the Chapel of St. Tekla, and the Chapel of Catherine. The current structure is fairly modern and is built primarily of white stone. The exterior features alternating bands of white and black stone, and the interior has numerous columns. 

**History:** The original church dates back to the Roman Period. After the Muslim conquest of Damascus, the church was closed until the 8th century. The church has served as the seat of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch since the 14th century. The church has been destroyed and rebuilt a number of times during its history, with the most recent renovation occurring in the mid-20th century.

**Significance:** This church is one of the oldest in Damascus. It is located within the ancient city gates and is on one of the most famous ancient streets in Damascus. It also holds the seat of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. 

**Present Day:** The church is an active place of worship today.
