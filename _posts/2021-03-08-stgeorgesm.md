**Etymology:** Named after St. George, a member of the Praetorian Guard under Roman Emperor Diocletian. 

**Religion:** Christianity: Greek Orthodox

**Earliest Date:** 5th Century

**Site:** The monastery is located in the Valley of the Christians, which has been a center of Greek Orthodox Christianity since the 6th century. It consists of two chapels, one of which has a wooden iconostasis, which presents carvings of the life of Christ. The entrance to the church features a triple arch and columns. It is also home to many ancient crosses, books, writings, and carvings. 

**History:** The monastery was originally built in the 6th century. One of its current chapels was built in the 13th century, with the other being completed in 1857. The lower court contains the remains of the original Byzantine monastery. 

**Significance:** The church is a major pilgrimage site for Syrian Christians, as it attracts visitors from across the country (and world) for the Feast of St. George on May 6th, and for the Feast of the Elevation of the Holy Cross on September 14th. 

**Present Day:** It remains as an active place of worship.
