**Etymology:** Named after St. Elian, also known as St. Julian or Mar Elian. He was a pious man that led a pilgrimage to Jerusalem 1500 years ago. 

**Religion:** Syrian Catholic

**Earliest Date:** 5th century CE

**Site:** The Monastery is located near the remote town of al-Qaryatain, which is located in the desert between Damascus and Palmyra. The church was made of mudbrick, and Mar Elian’s tomb was made of stone, engraved with simple circular patterns. The tomb features graffiti from worshippers of other faiths, including Islamic Arabic script and even a Star of David. There are a number of inscriptions adorned with an ornamental calligraphy dating back to the 15th century.

**History:** Mar Elian was martyred on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the 5th century. His followers then buried his body and built him a tomb. The monastery grew up around his tomb. Over time, the basic mudbrick structure turned into a site sacred to the Syrian Christian community. The Monastery underwent a significant renovation in 1938.  

**Significance:** The monastery contains the tomb of St. Julian, or Mar Elian, making it a major pilgrimage site for the Syrian Christian community. Moreover, the existence of the graffiti from other worshippers suggests that the site was important to Jews and Muslims as well.  

**Present Day:** The site was destroyed entirely by ISIS in 2015. The site was bulldozed, and Mar Elian’s tomb was exhumed, with his bones being crushed shortly after that. Many Christians, including a priest and many clergymen were kidnapped from the Monastery. They were later found alive and well, however, there are no Christians left at the Monastery or in the surrounding town.
