**Etymology:** The word Hermon likely originated from the Arabic term from the root ḥrm "sacred" meaning “sacred” 

**Religion:** Christian, Islamic, Jewish

**Earliest Date:** There has been evidence of habitation or activity since the Neolithic age. 

**Site:** The mountain belongs to the Anti-Lebanon mountain range and is the highest point in Syria at 9,232ft. The streams from Mt. Hermon contribute to the Jordan river. 

**History:** The site has been a place of ritual significance since the Bronze age, but there were no permanent settlements until the Seleucids settled in 200 BCE. Prior to monotheistic religions, Mount Hermon was mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh and an Ugaritic religious myth. There are roughly thirty temples on Mount Hermon and many of them were believed to have been constructed in by the Romans in the first or second centuries CE. Of these, Qasr Antar is the highest temple in the ancient world. These stone temples are dedicated to various Roman deities and inscribed with Greek epigraphy. In the Hebrew Bible, Mount Hermon is mentioned fifteen times and was the boundary of the Amorite kingdom, as far as Moses and Joshua conquered. Some Christian scholars suggest that the mountain is the possible location for the transfiguration of Christ. The site is also sacred to the Druze and they habitat the villages along the mountainside.

**Significance:** This is one of the most ancient sites in Syria. There has been habitation and possibly ritual activity on Mount Hermon for thousands of years. Though the is not an active religious site on the mountain, Mount Hermon looms large enough in the religious texts of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity to necessitate a place of significance. 

**Present Day:** The mountain’s summit is on the boarder of Lebanon and Syria. There is a UN position on the mountain called the “Hermon Hotel” and a ski resort.
