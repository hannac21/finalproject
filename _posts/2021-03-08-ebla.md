**Etymology:** Ebla is also called Tell Mardikh. 

**Religion:** Ancient "Syrian"

**Earliest Date:** Early Bronze age (3500 BCE)

**Site:** Ebla is one of the most extensive Bronze Age sites in Syria. The ruins of the ancient city are near the city of Aleppo and are a tourist destination and an active archaeological site.  

**History:** The site was first settled in the early bronze age growing into an expansive empire over the next thousand years. It was sacked circa 2300 BCE and circa 2000 BCE and rebuilt both times. The Amorites rebuilt and ruled the third Ebla until c. 1600 BCE when it was finally destroyed. Artifacts from all over the Middle East and Mediterranean have been uncovered suggesting a wide trade network. Also, its position midway between the Mediterranean Sea and the Euphrates river made it an essential trade point. Some of Ebla’s famous rivals were the city of Mari and the Akkadian empire; the legendary king Sargon sacked and burned the city. 

**Significance:** Ebla was such a prosperous city with a vast trading network that it rivaled the nearby Egyptian and Mesopotamia civilizations. Some of the most important finds are the Ebla Tablets which are written in both Eblaite, the indigenous language of Ebla, and Sumerian. There are more than 17,000 clay tablets from Ebla. The vast majority of them recorded the economic transactions of the palace in Ebla. These tablets are essential to furthering understanding of Bronze Age civilizations. 

**Present Day:** Unfortunately, Ebla has been subject to illegal excavations that have permanently damaged the site. It has also been extensively looted, especially in recent years. It was first excavated in 1964 so it is an active archeological dig with many more mysteries to uncover.
