**Etymology:** Dura may come from the Aramaic word duru, meaning fortress. The Greeks named the site “Europos” after the Macedonian birthplace of the Seleucids. 

**Religion:** Christianity, Judaism

**Earliest Date:** Originally founded in 303 BCE as a fortress. 

**Site:** The site, due to its abandonment in 256 CE, has an excellent archaeological record. Three of the best-preserved structures on this site are the synagogue, the church, and the Mithraeum. The synagogue was dated by an Aramaic inscription to 244 CE, and it is the best-preserved synagogue of its era. Its walls are frescoed with depictions of people and animals. The church is the earliest identified house-church in the world. It has less decoration than the synagogue but is still famous for its frescos. The Mithraeum, a temple to the Roman God Mithras, was dated to c. 170 CE. It also shares the decorated frescos of the synagogue and church, and the exterior was covered in graffiti. 

**History:** Dura Europos was established in the Hellenistic Period when the empire of Alexander the Great was divided after his death. It was strategically placed at the intersection of an east-west trade route near the Euphrates. The city was under Seleucid control under the c. 110 BCE, when it was conquered by the Iranian Parthians. The Parthians held the city briefly, and it was subsequently conquered by the Romans in the 2nd century CE. In 161, the city was severely damaged by an earthquake. However, after this, the city flourished under Roman control, and became cultural and economic hub. However, this prosperity was relatively short lived, as the Sasanians posed a new threat from the east in the 3rd century CE. The Romans struggled to fortify the city walls over the last century, and after a number of conflicts around the city, it was eventually captured and destroyed in 256. After this, the city was abandoned, and remained untouched until its discovery in 1920. 

**Significance:** Due to the amazing preservation of the site, Dura Europos has been coined by some as, “Pompeii of the Syrian Desert”. It is extremely important for archaeological reasons, and its level of preservation has revealed the comingling of cultures and religions that existed in the city. It provided excellent examples of early Christian and Jewish art. Moreover, it is home to the best-preserved synagogue of its era, as well as the earliest Christian house church. There are few areas in the world that serve as near-perfect representations of the combination of various cultures, religions, and ideas, and Dura Europos is one of them. Also, the site is included on the UNESCO List of Tentative World Heritage Sites. 

**Present Day:** The site faced massive destruction during the Syrian Civil War. Over half of the site was destroyed by looters, and it faced massive destruction from ISIS.
