**Etymology:** Called “Al-Jadideh” in Arabic, meaning new.

**Religion:** Christianity

**Earliest Date:** 14th century

**Site:** The site, located in the heart of Aleppo, is famous for its winding street pattern. It has many narrow allies, and its churches, homes, and other buildings are heavily decorated with intricate facades. 

**History:** The site began as a small suburb in the 14th century, and it slowly developed into an affluent urban area. Numerous Christian churches and cemetaries began popping up across the quarter. The area underwent a major revitalization in the late 20th century.  

**Significance:** The quarter is home to many famous churches, including the 40 Martyrs Cathedral. The area was very important to the historical and modern-day Christian community in Syria. The site is incorporated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site under the Ancient City of Aleppo.

**Present Day:** The site suffered severe damage during the Syrian Civil War. As Aleppo was ground zero for much of the conflict between 2011 and 2016, the site experienced a number of large underground explosions. Many buildings were damaged by combat, and a large portion of the city was looted. Currently, repair and renovation efforts are underway.
