**Etymology:** The church is named after the 40 martyrs of Sebaste, a group of Roman soldiers martyred in the early 4th century CE. 

**Religion:** Christianity: Armenian Apostolic Church 

**Earliest Date:** Mentioned in literary sources as early as 1476 CE, current structure completed in 1491

**Site:** The church is located in the Old Christian Quarter in Aleppo. It is famous among Armenian churches, as it is one of the only that has three altars. The church does not have a dome, but its bell tower is one of the few examples of baroque architecture in Aleppo. The cathedral is surrounded by the tombstones of clergymen and the elites of the community.

**History:** The current church building was originally completed in 1491. However, due to its original small size, it quickly underwent an extensive renovation in 1500. Additional renovations occurred in the 17th century, as a guesthouse was added to accommodate Armenian pilgrims traveling to and from Jerusalem. The belltower, famous for its Baroque architecture, was completed in 1912. The compound of the church also includes an Armenian school and the Church of the Holy Mother of God, which dates back to the 14th century. This church now serves as a museum. 

**Significance:** It currently serves as the seat of the Armenian Diocese of Beroea (which covers the provinces of Aleppo, Idlib, Raqqa, Lattakia, and Deir ez-Zor) and is one of the oldest churches in the Armenian community and Aleppo itself. The church also has numerous examples of ancient and modern-day icons, including a fresco of The Last Judgement, which was painted in 1703 by Nehmatallah Hovsep. The mosque was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986 as part of the ancient city of Aleppo.

**Present Day:** In April 2015, a large portion of the church compound was destroyed by ISIS. Reports linked the damage to both tunnel and aerial bombings. However, even though the compound experienced major damage, the church itself was wholly unharmed, and the bell tower remained standing. Reconstruction and renovations began in late 2016, and the church was reconsecrated in early 2019. On December 16th, 2019, the church held its first mass in seven years.
