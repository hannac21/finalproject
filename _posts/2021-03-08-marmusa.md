**Etymology:** Saint Moses, the son of an Ethiopian king, allegedly settled in the caves in the Qalmun mountains to pursue the life of the Christian ascetic. He was martyred soon after his arrival and the monastery named for him. 

**Religion:** Christianity: Syriac Catholic Church

**Earliest Date:** Sixth Century CE

**Site:** The complex monastic hermitage built into the Qalmun mountain range overlooking the valley. 

**History:** The site was possibly in use since the Neolithic period based off the most recent excavations of the surrounding area. The monastery began as a Byzantine watchtower outside the city of Damascus and was converted in the sixth century into a hermitage. It was rebuilt in the 11th century and fell into disrepair centuries later.

**Significance:**
The main church contains frescoes dating to the 11th and 12th centuries CE which are some of the best-preserved examples of Christian art from this area. Beneath the current frescoes, there are two more painting beneath. Modern technology has allowed scholars to analyze all three track the progression of Christian painting over the centuries. Fortunately, artist included the date in Arabic on most of the paintings which assists with dating other stylistic elements of the monastery and shows the adoption of the Arabic language by Christians in the medieval period. 

**Present day:** The site was abandoned for several centuries until the Syriac Catholics reclaimed the site for monastic living. There is a vibrant monastic community which welcomes travelers from all over the world.
