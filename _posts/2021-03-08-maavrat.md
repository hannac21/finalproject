**Etymology:** Named for the town of Maarat al Numan. Its name comes from the Aramaic word for cave, and the name of its first Muslim governor. 

**Religion:** Islam

**Earliest Date:** 12th century

**Site:** The most notable element of the mosque is the minaret. It was originally constructed in the first half of the 12th century but had to be rebuilt after an earthquake in 1170. In the center of the mosque exists a large, rectangular courtyard. The plan loosely mirrors that of the Umayyad Mosque. 

**History:** The mosque, built in the 12th century, was most likely constructed on a pagan temple. Numerous Byzantine and non-Islamic architectural features present in the most suggest this. The mosque has undergone a number of minor renovations throughout its history.  

**Significance:** The mosque has significant historical value, as it is one of the older mosques in Syria. The fact that it mirrors the plans of the Umayyad mosque suggest that it carried notable religious importance when it was built. 

**Present Day:** The mosque was severely damaged in air raids in 2016. It suffered structural damage, and many stone archways and walls have collapsed.
