This site was developed to serve as my capstone for my Digital Culture and Information Minor at Washington and Lee University. It was completed in Winter 2021 and is heavily influenced by my other coursework in Middle Eastern/South Asian Studies. Many thanks to my professors, Mackenzie Brooks and Antoine Edwards for helping make this project happen, Jason Mickel for introducing me to DCI in my sophomore year, and the rest of the DCI Faculty.

#### Flâneur
* This project was built using Flâneur, a Jekyll theme using the Leaflet mapping library. It was developed by [Dawn Childress](https://github.com/kirschbombe) and [Niqui O'Neill](https://github.com/dnoneill). Flâneur was ported from the earlier mapping and texts framework, [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier).
